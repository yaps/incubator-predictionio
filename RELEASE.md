# Release Notes and News

**Note:** For upgrade instructions please refer to [this page](http://predictionio.incubator.apache.org/resources/upgrade/).

## Version History

### 0.11.0

Apr ?, 2017

#### New Features

- PIO-30: Scala 2.11 support
- PIO-30: Spark 2 support
- PIO-49: Elasticsearch 5 support
- PIO-30, PIO-49: Flexible build system
- PIO-47, PIO-51: Removal of engine manifests
- PIO-49: Modularized storage backend modules
- PIO-45: Self cleaning data source

#### Behavior Changes

- PIO-25: `pio-start-all` will no longer start PostgreSQL if it is not being
  used.
- PIO-47, PIO-51: `pio build` no longer requires access to the metadata
  repository. `pio` commands will now accept an optional `--engine-dir`
  parameter if you want to run `pio build`, `pio train`, or `pio deploy` outside
  of an engine directory. This is an interim solution before an engine registry
  feature becomes available in the future.
- PIO-49: PostgreSQL JDBC driver is no longer bundled with the core assembly. If
  you are using PostgreSQL, you must download the JDBC driver and update your
  configuration to point to the correct JDBC driver file.
- PIO-54: New generated access keys will no longer start with a `-` character.

#### Other Changes

- PIO-28: Code refactoring of the command line interface. It is now possible to
  develop new interfaces that perform the same functionalities provided by the
  CLI.
- PIO-53: Integration tests can now be tied to every single Git commit, without
  the need to update the official test Docker image.
- The meta data and model data access object methods are now public and marked
  as Core Developer API.
