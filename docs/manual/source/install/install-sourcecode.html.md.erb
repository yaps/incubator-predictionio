INFO: Assuming you are following the directory structure in the followoing,
replace `/home/abc` with your own home directory wherever you see it.

## Downloading Source Code

Download Apache PredictionIO (incubating) <%= data.versions.pio %> from an
Apache [mirror](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/predictionio/<%=
data.versions.pio %>/apache-predictionio-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz). 

## Building

Run the following at the directory where you downloaded the source code to build
Apache PredictionIO (incubating). By default, the build will be against

* Scala 2.10.6
* Spark 1.6.3
* Hadoop 2.6.5
* Elasticsearch 1.7.6

```
$ tar zxvf apache-predictionio-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
$ cd apache-predictionio-<%= data.versions.pio %>
$ ./make-distribution.sh
```

You should see something like the following when it finishes building
successfully.

```
...
PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/sbt/sbt
PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/conf/
PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/conf/pio-env.sh
PredictionIO binary distribution created at PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
```

Extract the binary distribution you have just built.

```
$ tar zxvf PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
```

### Building against Different Versions of Dependencies

Starting from version 0.11.0, PredictionIO can be built against different
versions of dependencies. As of writing, one could build PredictionIO against
these different dependencies:

* Scala 2.10.x, 2.11.x
* Spark 1.6.x, 2.0.x, 2.1.x
* Hadoop 2.4.x to 2.7.x
* Elasticsearch 1.7.x, 5.x

As an example, if you want to build PredictionIO to support Scala 2.11.8,
Spark 2.1.0, and Elasticsearch 5.3.0, you can do

```
$ ./make-distribution.sh -Dscala.version=2.11.8 -Dspark.version=2.1.0 -Delasticsearch.version=5.3.0
```

## Installing Dependencies

Let us install dependencies inside a subdirectory of the Apache PredictionIO
(incubating) installation. By following this convention, you can use
Apache PredictionIO (incubating)'s default configuration as is.

```
$ mkdir PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/vendors
```


### Spark Setup

<%= partial 'shared/install/spark' %>


### Storage Setup

#### <a name="pgsql"></a>PostgreSQL Setup

WARNING: You may skip this section if you are not using PostgreSQL.

<%=partial 'shared/install/postgres' %>

#### HBase and Elasticsearch Setup

##### Elasticsearch Setup

WARNING: You may skip this section if you are not using Elasticsearch.

<%= partial 'shared/install/elasticsearch' %>


##### <a name="hbase"></a>HBase Setup

WARNING: You may skip this section if you are not using HBase.

<%= partial 'shared/install/hbase' %>


In addition, you must set your environment variable `JAVA_HOME`. For example, in
`/home/abc/.bashrc` add the following line:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
```


<%= partial 'shared/install/dependent_services' %>





Now you have installed everything you need!

<%= partial 'shared/install/proceed_template' %>
